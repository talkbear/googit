# :simple-hellofresh: Welcome to the Googit  community! (_Î±_ version)
<span class="float-left mr-2.5">![[googit-logo.jpeg|164]]</span>

<span>

[[Googit]] is an online community built for those who wish to appreciate or dig deep into a game for any purpose. 

For that we begin with taking games apart into pieces that is describable with [[Rich text]], then creating assets and materials like _Game Profiles_, _Character Profiles_, _Map Profiles_, _Innovative Rules (Mechanism)_, _Game Reviews_, _Glossary_ etc as [[Study resources]] all organized by a note-taking technique created by the Nobel Prize Winning Physicist [[Richard Feynman]]. [[Documented game]] make it more retrievable within search engines for academic or non-academic use.
</span>

Also we do play a role in identifying the academic value of games through materials created or edited by volunteer authors.
